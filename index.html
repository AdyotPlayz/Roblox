                <p>Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and a company. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.[7][8]

                    Roblox is free to play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called Robux. As of August 2020, Roblox had over 164 million monthly active users, including more than half of all American children under 16.[9][10] Although Roblox has received generally positive reviews from critics, it has faced criticism for its moderation, microtransactions, and exploitative practices directed toward children.</p>

                  <p>Roblox allows players to create their own games using its proprietary engine, Roblox Studio, which can then be played by other users.[11] Games (called "experiences" by the corporation) are made with an object-oriented & open-source programming language based on Lua, known as LuaU.[12][13] Users are able to create purchasable content through one-time purchases, known as "game passes", as well as microtransactions which can be purchased more than once, known as "developer products" or "products".[14][15] The majority of games produced using Roblox Studio are developed by minors, and a total of 20 million games a year are produced using it.</p>

                  <h1>HISTORY</h1> <img src="91RYrEAjTSL.jpg" width="800"> 
                  <p>The beta version of Roblox was created by co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 under the name DynaBlocks.[45] Baszucki started testing the first demos that year.[46] In 2005, the company changed its name to Roblox,[46] and it officially launched on September 1, 2006.[1] In March 2007, Roblox became compliant with COPPA, with the addition of safe chat, a change that limited the communication ability of users under the age of 13 by restricting them to selecting predefined messages from a menu.[47] In August, Roblox applied server improvements and released a premium membership service named "Builders Club".[48] This paid membership feature was rebranded as Roblox Premium in September 2019.[49]

                    In December 2011, Roblox held their first Hack Week, an annual event where Roblox developers work on outside-the-box ideas for new developments to present to the company.[50][51] On December 11, 2012, an iOS version of Roblox was released,[3] and on July 16, 2014, an Android version was released.[4] On October 1, 2013, Roblox released its Developer Exchange program, allowing developers to exchange Robux earned from their games into real-world currencies.[52]
                    
                    On May 31, 2015, a feature called 'Smooth Terrain' was added, increasing the graphical fidelity of the terrain and changing the physics engine from a block-oriented style to a smoother and more realistic one.[53] On November 20, Roblox was launched on Xbox One, with an initial selection of 15 games chosen by Roblox staff.[5] New Roblox games for the Xbox One have to go through an approval process, and are subject to the Entertainment Software Ratings Board standards.[54]
                    
                    In April 2016, Roblox launched Roblox VR for Oculus Rift. At the time of release, more than ten million games were available in 3D.[55] Around the same time period, the safe chat feature was removed and replaced by a system based on a whitelist with a set of acceptable words for users under 13 years old and a set of blacklisted words for other users.[56][failed verification] In June, the company launched a version compatible with Windows 10. While the game platform has had a presence on the PC since 2004, when its web version was created, this was the first time it was upgraded with a standalone launcher built for Windows.[57]
                    
                    Throughout 2017, Roblox engaged in a number of updates to its server technology, as the technology they were operating on until that point was out of date and led to frequent outages.[58] Also in 2017, Roblox closed its official forums.[59] In November 2018, the ability for a player to play as a "guest", without an account, which had been progressively restricted over the previous two years, was removed entirely.[60] In July 2020, Roblox announced the creation of “Party Place”, which functions as an online hangout. The feature was created using new technology that had been used during the 2020 Bloxy Awards, and was designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[61] Roblox was granted permission to release in China on December 3, 2020.[62] In 2021, Roblox bought chat platform Guilded.[63] In October 2021, Roblox experienced its longest downtime to date, with services being unavailable for three days.[64][65][66]
                    
                    In July 2022, a 4 GB archive of internal documents related to the platform's creators, including personal data, were leaked by an unidentified hacker. Roblox stated "[t]hese stolen documents were illegally obtained as part of an extortion scheme that we refused to cooperate with."[67]</p>

                  <p>Critical reception
                    Roblox has generally received positive reviews. Common Sense Media gave it 4 out of 5 stars, praising the website's variety of games and ability to encourage creativity in children, while finding that the decentralized nature of the platform meant game quality varied, and recommended disabling chat functions for young players to prevent possibly harmful interactions.[80] Patricia E. Vance of the Family Online Safety Institute advised parents to monitor their child's interactions on the platform, but praised the platform for "allow[ing] kids to play, explore, socialize, create and learn in a self-directed way", and granted especial praise to Roblox Studio for its ability to encourage children to experience game development.[81] Trusted Reviews, in its overview of the platform, also praised Roblox Studio, stating that “for anyone seeking to develop their computer science skills, or create projects that will instantly receive feedback from a huge audience, the appeal is obvious”.[82] Craig Hurda, writing in Android Guys, gave a more moderate review, praising the number of games available and finding that the game was entertaining for children, while also finding that the platform's audio was "hit-or-miss" and declaring that it had limited appeal for adult players.[83]
                    
                    Criticism
                    Roblox has received widespread criticism for its chat filtration system.[84][85] Although Roblox's filtration system, Community Sift,[86] censors and removes most inappropriate messages and content, some can still avoid the system. To combat these issues, Roblox has 1,600 people working to remove such content from the platform.[84] Roblox offers privacy settings; parents can limit what people a user can contact, restricting access to private servers, and turning on parental control.[87]
                    
                    Though sexual content is prohibited on Roblox, the platform has received substantial criticism for the presence of sexually explicit games and imagery within it. This content includes items like virtual sex clubs and nightclubs, with creators of said content largely communicating through third-party platforms which cannot be regulated by Roblox moderators.[88] Such spaces on Roblox are often called "condos" and there is a constant effort in taking those places down.[89] A 2020 investigation by Fast Company found that sexual content was still prevalent within Roblox, with attempts by moderators to remove it being likened to "whack-a-mole",[90][91] though it was also found that the situation had generally improved in the recent years prior to the report.[90]
                    
                    Some extremist role-playing communities and scenarios present in Roblox have caused controversy.[92]
                    
                    Roblox has also been criticised for making it easy for children to spend large sums of money through microtransactions, leading to numerous instances where children have spent large sums of money on the platform without parents' knowledge,[93][94] and deleting the accounts of players who file chargebacks or request refunds for Robux payments through their banks, card issuers or other third-party companies.[95] Professor Jane Juffer at Cornell University accused Roblox of encouraging consumerism in children.[96]
                    
                    Roblox has been accused by the investigative journalism YouTube channel People Make Games of "exploiting" child game developers by promising them huge amounts of money when they monetize their games, while only giving them little to no money in return by having high revenue cuts, an exchange rate in selling Robux lower than the rate for buying Robux, and lack of methods to make their games easily discoverable. This was likened to company scrip.[97][98] In a discussion with Axios, Roblox chief product officer (CPO) Manuel Bronstein responded by saying that Roblox's intent is to give more money to its community developers.[99] After Roblox requested the channel to take down the video, People Make Games released further accusations of practices endangering child safety, such as a lack of oversight of developers and a method for people to address developer abuse, leading to child developers being exploited for labor on third-party platforms, allowing a developer to seemingly continue monetizing and having control of game development despite having their personal account banned for reportedly sexually preying on a child, and running the collectibles market to function like gambling, refusing to help a developer whose account was hacked and had its collectibles and assets stolen and encouraging children to seek unofficial and unsafe trading sites to easily obtain highly-valuable items.[59][100][101][102]
                    
                    In April 2022, Truth in Advertising filed a complaint against Roblox with the Federal Trade Commission[103] for deceptive marketing.[104]

                    See also: List of Roblox games
                    Due to its status as a games platform, Roblox has a variety of popular games. As of May 2020, the most popular games on Roblox had over 10 million monthly active players each. As of August 2020, at least 20 games had been played more than one billion times, and at least 5,000 have been played more than one million times.[105] TechCrunch noted in March 2021 that Roblox games are largely distinct from established traditions in free-to-play video games, finding that successful Roblox games were geared towards immediate satisfaction, and finding that the addition of tutorials significantly decreased player engagement, contrary to established wisdom about free-to-play games.[106]
                    
                    Revenue
                    During the 2017 Roblox Developers Conference, officials said that creators on the game platform, of which there were about 1.7 million as of 2017,[107] collectively earned at least $30 million in 2017.[108] The iOS version of Roblox passed $1 billion of lifetime revenue in November 2019, $1.5 billion in June 2020 and $2 billion in October 2020, making it the iOS app with the second-highest revenue.[109][7] Several individual games on Roblox have accumulated revenues of over $10 million,[110] while developers as a whole on the platform were collectively projected to have earned around $250 million over the course of 2020.[111] It became the third highest-grossing game of 2020, with a revenue of $2.29 billion, below the Tencent titles PUBG and Honor of Kings.[112]</p>

                 <p>Activism
                  Users of Roblox have been noted for their efforts against racism, with numerous regular users and co-founder Baszucki having declared their support for the George Floyd protests and Black Lives Matter.[68][69] In August 2019, an investigation by NBC News revealed over 100 accounts linked to far-right and neo-Nazi groups. After being contacted about the accounts by NBC, Roblox moderators removed them.[70]
                  
                  Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
                  The COVID-19 pandemic has affected Roblox in numerous ways. Due to quarantines imposed by the pandemic limiting social interaction, Roblox is being used as a way for children to communicate with each other.[71] One of the most noted ways that this method of communication is being carried out is the phenomenon of birthday parties being held on the platform.[72][73] COVID-19 has caused a substantial increase in both the platform's revenue and the number of players on it, in line with similar effects experienced by the majority of the gaming industry, as players forced to remain indoors due to COVID-19 lockdowns spent more time playing video games.[74][75]
                  
                  "Oof" sound effect
                  From its release until November 2020, Roblox's sound effect for when a character dies was an "oof" sound, which became a substantial part of the platform's reputation due to its status as a meme.[76] The sound was originally produced by video game composer Tommy Tallarico for the 2000 video game Messiah, and he and Roblox entered into a copyright dispute. The dispute ended in 2022 when Roblox pulled the sound from their platform and replaced it with a new sound effect.[77][78][79]</p>
